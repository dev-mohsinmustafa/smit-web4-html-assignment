    <h1>Chairman Message</h1>
    <p>Assalam-o-Alaikum</p>
    <br>
    <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? (Surat Baqara, Verse
        245)</p>
    <br>
    <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give Qarz-e-Hasana
        because it is in manâ€™s nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz because it is
        returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his message to the
        Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way
        It has been playing a significant role in promoting welfare and development activities by engaging children,
        orphans, ultra poor and young people to bring positive changes in their lives. We believe in equal rights for
        every human being. Our main aim is to reach more people, families and communities through partnership with more
        national, international donor agencies and community-based organizations (CBOs)"</p>
    <br>
    <p>Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded Saylani Welfare with the highest favor by sending those people our way who
        follow the teachings of th those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only
        spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy
        till the Day of Judgement.</p>
